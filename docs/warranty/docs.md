# LarkSpur Industries Hardware Warranty Policy

We build hardware for robotics, and we know that robotics is chaotic. Our warranty is designed to be fair, simple, and supportive of teams.

## 1. Manufacturing Warranty (90 Days) {#manufacturing}

We stand behind our build quality. If your Marigold-5 has a defect from the factory, we will replace it.

**What is covered:**
- Dead on Arrival (DOA) units
- Component failure under normal load
- Soldering defects
- Assembly errors

**Coverage Period:** 90 days from the date of delivery.

**Resolution:** We will ship a replacement unit at no cost to you.

## 2. The "FRC Reality" Exclusions {#exclusions}

We cannot cover damage caused by installation errors or field abuse. The following scenarios void the manufacturing warranty:

- **Short Circuits:** Caused by stray wire strands or metal debris entering the case or bridging input terminals.
- **Physical Damage:** Crushed cases, drilled-through PCBs, or impact damage from robot collisions.
- **Modifications:** Soldering directly to the PCB (outside of the provided terminals) or removing components.

## 3. "Crash Replacement" Program {#crash-replacement}

> We know mistakes happen in the heat of Build Season. If you or a student accidentally destroys a Marigold-5 (over-heating, metal shavings, etc.), we won't leave you stranded.

**The Deal:** Send us a photo of the damaged unit.

**The Discount:** We will send you a code for 25% off a replacement unit.

**How to Claim:** 
Email a photo and your original order number to [support@larkspurindustries.com](mailto:support@larkspurindustries.com)

## 4. Right to Repair {#right-to-repair}

> Opening the case does **NOT** void your warranty.
>
> We believe students should learn how their hardware works. You are encouraged to open the Marigold-5, inspect the PCB, and learn from the design. Your warranty is only void if you damage the device while doing so.
